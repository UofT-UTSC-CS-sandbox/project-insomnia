## Web application description

An online shopping application is a software program designed to enable users to browse and purchase products and services from the comfort of their own devices. The application typically features an intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily search for products by category, brand, price, color, or any other relevant criteria.

In addition to the user version, the online shopping application also includes a seller version, which allows businesses to create and manage their online stores within the application. Sellers can upload product images, descriptions, and prices, as well as track inventory and process orders from customers. 

The application may include a variety of features to enhance the shopping experience for both users and sellers, such as product reviews and ratings. Users can also view images, descriptions, and specifications for each item.

In addition to shopping, the online shopping application offers other features, such as the ability to track orders, view order history, and manage account settings.

Overall, the online shopping application is a convenient and efficient way for users to purchase products and services without leaving their homes or office. For sellers, it provides a platform to reach a wider audience and sell their products online, without the need for a physical storefront. The application provides a streamlined shopping experience for users and can offer a wider selection of products and services than physical stores.
